# Importing and creating a set of input data
# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# The data used for the construction of a model in GemPy is stored in
# Python objects. The main data classes are:
# 
# ::
#
#     -  Surface_points
#     -  Orientations
#     -  Grid
#     -  Surfaces
#     -  Series
#     -  Additional data
#     -  Faults
#
# We will see each of this class in further detail in the future.
# 
# Most of data can also be generated from raw data that comes in the form
# of CSV-files (CSV = comma-separated values). Such files might be
# attained by exporting model data from a different program such as
# GeoModeller or by simply creating it in spreadsheet software such as
# Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.
# 
# In this tutorial, all input data is created by importing such CSV-files.
# These exemplary files can be found in the ``input_data`` folder in the
# root folder of GemPy. The data comprises :math:`x`-, :math:`y`- and
# :math:`z`-positional values for all surface points and orientation
# measurements. For the latter, poles, azimuth and polarity are
# additionally included. Surface points are furthermore assigned a
# formation. This might be a lithological unit such as "Sandstone" or a
# structural feature such as "Main Fault". It is decisive to remember
# that, in GemPy, interface position points mark the **bottom** of a
# layer. If such points are needed to resemble a top of a formation (e.g.
# when modeling an intrusion), this can be achieved by defining a
# respectively inverted orientation measurement.
# 
# As we generate our ``Data`` from CSV-files, we also have to define our
# model's real extent in :math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`z`, as well as
# declare a desired resolution for each axis. This resolution will in turn
# determine the number of voxels used during modeling. Here, we rely on a
# medium resolution of 50x50x50, amounting to 125,000 voxels. The model
# extent should be chosen in a way that it contains all relevant data in a
# representative space. As our model voxels are not cubes, but prisms, the
# resolution can take a different shape than the extent. We don't
# recommend going much higher than 100 cells in every direction (1,000,000
# voxels), as higher resolutions will become increasingly expensive to
# compute.

# Declaring the sequential order of geological formations
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# -  TODO update this section
# 
# We want our geological units to appear in the correct order relative to
# age. Such order might for example be given by a depositional sequence of
# stratigraphy, unconformities due to erosion or other lithological
# genesis events such as igneous intrusions. A similar age-related order
# is to be declared for the faults in our model. In GemPy, the function
# ``set_series`` is used to assign formations to different sequential
# series via declaration in a Python dictionary.
# 
# Defining the correct order of series is vital to the construction of the
# model! If you are using Python >3.6, the age-related order will already
# be defined by the order of key entries, i.e. the first entry is the
# youngest series, the last one the oldest. For older versions of Python,
# you will have to specify the correct order as a separate list attribute
# "``order_series``\ " (see cell below).
# 
# You can assign several surfaces to one series. The order of the units
# within such as series is only relevant for the color code, thus we
# recommend to be consistent. You can define this order via another
# attribute "``order_formations``/ " or by using the specific command
# ``set_order_formations``. (If the order of the pile differs from the
# final result the color of the interfaces and input data will be
# different.)
# 
# Every fault is treated as an independent series and have to be at set at
# the **top of the pile**. The relative order between the distinct faults
# defines the tectonic relation between them (first entry is the
# youngest).
# 
# In a model with simple sequential stratigraphy, all layer formations can
# be assigned to one single series without a problem. All unit boundaries
# and their order would then be given by interface points. However, to
# model more complex lithostratigraphical relations and interactions, the
# definition of separate series becomes important. For example, you would
# need to declare a "newer" series to model an unconformity or an
# intrusion that disturbs older stratigraphy.
# 
# By default we create a simple sequence inferred by the data:
# 


# %%
# Our example model comprises four main layers (plus an underlying
# basement that is automatically generated by GemPy) and one main normal
# fault displacing those layers. Assuming a simple stratigraphy where each
# younger unit was deposited onto the underlying older one, we can assign
# these layer formations to one series called "Strat\_Series". For the
# fault, we declare a respective "Fault\_Series" as the first key entry in
# the ``set_series`` dictionary. We could give any other names to these
# series, the formations however have to be referred to as named in the
# input data.

# Returning information from our input data
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Our model input data, here named "*geo\_model*", contains all the
# information that is essential for the construction of our model. You can
# access different types of information by using ``gp.get_data`` or simply
# by accessiong the atrribues.
# 
# We can, for example, return the coordinates of our modeling grid via:
# 

# %% 
geo_model.grid

# %%
# As mentioned before, GemPy's core algorithm is based on interpolation of
# two types of data: - surface\_points and - orientation measurements
# 
# (if you want to know more on how this this interpolation algorithm
# works, checkout our paper: https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/1/2019/gmd-12-1-2019.pdf).
# 
# We introduced the function ``get\_data`` above. You can also specify which
# kind of data you want to call, by declaring the string attribute
# "*dtype*" to be either ``'surface_points'`` (interfaces) or ``'orientations'``\ .
# 
# Interfaces Dataframe:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 

# %% 
gp.get_data(geo_model, 'surface_points').head()

# %%
# Orientations Dataframe:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 

# %% 
gp.get_data(geo_model, 'orientations')

# %%
# Notice that now all **surfaces** have been assigned to a **series** and
# are displayed in the correct order (from young to old).
# 
# Visualizing input data
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# We can also visualize our input data. This might for example be useful
# to check if all points and measurements are defined the way we want them
# to. Using the function ``plot_data``\ , we attain a 2D projection of our
# data points onto a plane of chosen *direction* (we can choose this
# attribute to be either :math:`x`, :math:`y` or :math:`z`).
# 

# %%
plot = gp.plot_2d(geo_model, show_lith=False, show_boundaries=False)
plt.show()

# %%
# Using ``plot_data_3D``\ , we can also visualize this data in 3D. Note that
# direct 3D visualization in GemPy requires `the Visualization
# Toolkit <https://www.vtk.org/>`__ (VTK) to be installed.
# 
# All 3D plots in GemPy are interactive. This means that we can drag
# and drop any data point and measurement. The perpendicular axis views in
# VTK are particularly useful to move points solely on a desired 2D plane.
# Any changes will then be stored permanently in the "InputData"
# dataframe. If we want to reset our data points, we will then need to
# reload our original input data.
# 
# Executing the cell below will open a new window with a 3D interactive
# plot of our data.


# %%
gpv = gp.plot_3d(geo_model, image=False, plotter_type='basic')

# %%
# Model generation
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Once we have made sure that we have defined all our primary information
# as desired in our object ``DataManagement.InputData`` (named
# ``geo_data`` in these tutorials), we can continue with the next step
# towards creating our geological model: preparing the input data for
# interpolation.
# 
# This is done by generating an ``InterpolatorData`` object (named
# ``interp_data`` in these tutorials) from our ``InputData`` object via
# the following function:
# 

# %% 
gp.set_interpolator(geo_model,
                    compile_theano=True,
                    theano_optimizer='fast_compile',
                    )

# %%
# This function rescales the extent and coordinates of the original data
# (and store it in the attribute ``geo_data_res`` which behaves as a usual
# ``InputData`` object) and adds mathematical parameters that are needed
# for conducting the interpolation. The computation of this step may take
# a while, as it also compiles a theano function which is required for the
# model computation. However, should this not be needed, we can skip it by
# declaring ``compile_theano = False`` in the function.
# 
# Furthermore, this preparation process includes an assignment of numbers
# to each formation. Note that GemPy's always creates a default basement
# formation as the last formation number. Afterwards, numbers are
# allocated from youngest to oldest as defined by the sequence of series
# and formations. On the property ``formations`` on our interpolation
# data, we can find out which number has been assigned to which formation:
# 


# %%
# The parameters used for the interpolation can be returned using the
# function ``get_kriging_parameters``. These are generated automatically
# from the original data, but can be changed if needed. However, users
# should be careful doing so, if they do not fully understand their
# significance.
# 

# %% 
gp.get_data(geo_model, 'kriging')

# %%
# At this point, we have all we need to compute our full model via
# ``compute_model``. By default, this will return two separate solutions
# in the form of arrays. The first gives information on the lithological
# formations, the second on the fault network in the model. These arrays
# consist of two subarrays as entries each:
# 
# 1. Lithology block model solution:
# 
#    -  Entry [0]: This array shows what kind of lithological formation is
#       found in each voxel, as indicated by a respective
#       formation\_number.
#    -  Entry [1]: Potential field array that represents the orientation
#       of lithological units and layers in the block model.
# 
# 2. Fault network block model solution:
# 
#    -  Entry [0]: Array in which all fault-separated areas of the model
#       are represented by a distinct number contained in each voxel.
#    -  Entry [1]: Potential field array related to the fault network in
#       the block model.
# 
# Below, we illustrate these different model solutions and how they can be
# used.
# 


# %% 
sol = gp.compute_model(geo_model)

# %%

# %% 
geo_model.solutions

# %%
# Direct model visualization in GemPy
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Model solutions can be easily visualized in 2D sections in GemPy
# directly. Let's take a look at our lithology block:
#

# %%
gp.plot_2d(geo_model, show_data=True)
plt.show()
# %% 


# %%
# With ``cell_number=25`` and remembering that we defined our resolution
# to be 50 cells in each direction, we have chosen a section going through
# the middle of our block. We have moved 25 cells in ``direction='y'``,
# the plot thus depicts a plane parallel to the :math:`x`- and
# :math:`y`-axes. Setting ``plot_data=True``, we could plot original data
# together with the results. Changing the values for ``cell_number`` and
# ``direction``, we can move through our 3D block model and explore it by
# looking at different 2D planes.
# 
# We can do the same with out lithological scalar-field solution:
# 

# %%
gp.plot_2d(geo_model, show_data=False, show_scalar=True, show_lith=False)
plt.show()

# %%
gp.plot_2d(geo_model, series_n=1, show_data=False, show_scalar=True, show_lith=False)
plt.show()

# %%
# This illustrates well the fold-related deformation of the stratigraphy,
# as well as the way the layers are influenced by the fault.
# 
# The fault network modeling solutions can be visualized in the same way:
# 

# %% 
geo_model.solutions.scalar_field_at_surface_points

# %%
gp.plot_2d(geo_model, show_block=True, show_lith=False)
plt.show()

# %%
gp.plot_2d(geo_model, series_n=1, show_block=True, show_lith=False)
plt.show()

# %%
# Marching cubes and vtk visualization
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# In addition to 2D sections we can extract surfaces to visualize in 3D
# renderers. Surfaces can be visualized as 3D triangle complexes in VTK
# (see function plot\_surfaces\_3D below). To create these triangles, we
# need to extract respective vertices and simplices from the potential
# fields of lithologies and faults. This process is automatized in GemPy
# with the function ``get_surface``\ .
# 

# %% 
ver, sim = gp.get_surfaces(geo_model)
gpv = gp.plot_3d(geo_model, image=False, plotter_type='basic')

# %%
# Using the rescaled interpolation data, we can also run our 3D VTK
# visualization in an interactive mode which allows us to alter and update
# our model in real time. Similarly to the interactive 3D visualization of
# our input data, the changes are permanently saved (in the
# ``InterpolationInput.dataframe`` object). Additionally, the resulting changes
# in the geological models are re-computed in real time.
# 


# %%
# Adding topography
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
geo_model.set_topography(d_z=(350, 750))

# %%
gp.compute_model(geo_model)
gp.plot_2d(geo_model, show_topography=True)
plt.show()


# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 9
gpv = gp.plot_3d(geo_model, plotter_type='basic', show_topography=True, show_surfaces=True,
                 show_lith=True,
                 image=False)

# %%
# Compute at a given location
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# This is done by modifying the grid to a custom grid and recomputing.
# Notice that the results are given as *grid + surfaces\_points\_ref +
# surface\_points\_rest locations*
# 

# %% 
x_i = np.array([[3, 5, 6]])
sol = gp.compute_model(geo_model, at=x_i)

# %%
# Therefore if we just want the value at **x\_i**:

# %%
sol.custom

# %%
# This return the id, and the scalar field values for each series

# %%
# Save the model

# GemPy uses Python [pickle] for fast storing temporary objects
# (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). However, module version
# consistency is required. For loading a pickle into GemPy, you have to
# make sure that you are using the same version of pickle and dependent
# modules (e.g.: ``Pandas``, ``NumPy``) as were used when the data was
# originally stored.
# 
# For long term-safer storage we can export the ``pandas.DataFrames`` to
# csv by using:
